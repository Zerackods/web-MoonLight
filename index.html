            In astronomy, the full moon is the phase of the Moon when its visible hemisphere is fully illuminated from
            the Earth. The full moon occurs when our planet is positioned exactly between the Sun and the Moon. The Moon,
            as such, has no light of its own, so it reflects the light of the Sun. That is why, during the full moon,
            what we see is the Moon with its visible face fully illuminated by sunlight. The Moon makes an orbital path
            around the planet Earth that lasts 27.3 days, which is known as the lunar cycle or sidereal month.
            </p>

            <p>Due to the Earth's translational motion around the Sun, the Moon requires approximately two more days to be
            positioned in front of the Sun with the Earth in between. This means that full moons occur every 28.531
            days, known as a synodic month. Each full moon can last approximately one full night.
            As such, the full moon marks the middle of the lunar month, which in turn is made up of four phases known as
            the new moon, crescent, full moon and waning quarter. It is during the full moon that lunar eclipses occur.</p>
                
            <p>Popularly, there is a set of beliefs associated with the full moon. It is said, for example, that our
            behavior is altered, that criminality goes up, and that traffic accidents and childbirths increase.
            Also, some claim that during full moons people are more prone to insomnia and dementia (lunatics). Another
            popular belief is that of lycanthropy, or the transformation of a man into a wolf, which is said to occur on
            full moon nights. However, it is important to emphasize that all these are just popular beliefs, with no
            scientific basis.</p>
